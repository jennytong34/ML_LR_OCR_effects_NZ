# ML_OCReffects_NZ

2020 is a year of change as COVID emerges deeply into our lives. One of the most influential components of such changes in NZ is the policies implemented by RBNZ concerning OCR.

It is argued that these changes in OCRs drive economic growth and infrastructure. On the other hand, associated negative effects posibly are rising inflation rates, enhancing inequlity, rising housing price and so on.

This project is aimed at looking at these effects from a quantitative point of views using Linear Regression in Supervised ML. It only acts as a tool for a mere economics student to learn and understand the market and does not exhibit any political opinions as such! :)

Welcome!
